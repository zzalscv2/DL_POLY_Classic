\D{} was developed under the auspices of the 
Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council, and the former Science and
Engineering Research Council, under grants from the Computational
Science Initiative and the Science and Materials Computing Committee.

\vspace{.25 in} Advice, assistance and encouragement in the development of \D{}
has been given by many people. We gratefully acknowledge the comments,
feedback and bug reports from the CCP5 community in the United Kingdom and
throughout the world. Maurice Leslie contributed the NOSQUISH rotational
algorithm at the heart of many of the rigid body routines. The hyperdynamics
algorithms in \D{} were developed in a collaboration with Duncan Harris and John
Harding. The solvation, free energy and solvent induced spectral shift
features were developed in collaboration with P.-A. Cazade, P. Bordat and
R. Brown at the University of Pau. Travel between Pau and Daresbury by the
collaborators was enabled by a grant from the Franco-British Alliance fund.
