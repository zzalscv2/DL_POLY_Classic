The DL_POLY Classic README File

DL_POLY Classic is a general purpose (parallel and serial)
molecular dynamics simulation package derived from the package
known as DL_POLY_2 (Version 20) which was originally written by
W. Smith and T.R. Forester at Daresbury Laboratory to support the
CCP5 project `Computer Simulation of Condensed Phases'. The terms
under which this package is made available are given in the
DL_POLY Classic Licence supplied with the source code.

The availability of this package carries no obligation on the
part of the authors, CCP5, the suppliers or laboratory of
origin. In particular, no support or advice is offered. Users of
the package are referred to the User Manual supplied.

DL_POLY Classic is distinct from the packages DL_POLY_3 or
DL_POLY_4, which are available from Daresbury Laboratory under
DIFFERENT licence terms. Permissions granted under the DL_POLY
Classic Licence DO NOT extend to DL_POLY_3 or DL_POLY_4.
